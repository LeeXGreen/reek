## Quickstart

`reek` is a tool that examines Ruby classes, modules and methods and reports any [Code Smells](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Code-Smells) it finds. Install it like this:

```Bash
gem install reek
```

and run it like this:

```Bash
reek [options] [dir_or_source_file]*
```

## Example

Imagine a source file <tt>demo.rb</tt> containing:

```Ruby
class Dirty
  # This method smells of :reek:NestedIterators but ignores them
  def awful(x, y, offset = 0, log = false)
    puts @screen.title
    @screen = widgets.map {|w| w.each {|key| key += 3}}
    puts @screen.contents
  end
end
```

`reek` will report the following code smells in this file:

```
$ reek demo.rb
spec/samples/demo/demo.rb -- 6 warnings:
  Dirty has no descriptive comment (IrresponsibleModule)
  Dirty#awful has 4 parameters (LongParameterList)
  Dirty#awful has boolean parameter 'log' (ControlCouple)
  Dirty#awful has the parameter name 'x' (UncommunicativeName)
  Dirty#awful has the parameter name 'y' (UncommunicativeName)
  Dirty#awful has the variable name 'w' (UncommunicativeName)
  Dirty#awful has unused parameter 'log' (UnusedParameters)
  Dirty#awful has unused parameter 'offset' (UnusedParameters)
  Dirty#awful has unused parameter 'x' (UnusedParameters)
  Dirty#awful has unused parameter 'y' (UnusedParameters)
```

## Code smells

`reek` currently includes checks for some aspects of [Control Couple](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Control-Couple), [Data Clump](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Data-Clump), [Feature Envy](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Feature-Envy), [Large Class](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Large-Class), [Long Parameter List](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Long-Parameter-List), [Simulated Polymorphism](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Simulated-Polymorphism), [Too Many Statements](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Too-Many-Statements), [Uncommunicative Name](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Uncommunicative-Name), [Unused Parameters](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Unused-Parameters) and more. See the [Code Smells](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Code-Smells) for up to date details of exactly what `reek` will check in your code.

## Configuration

### CLI

For a basic overview, run

```Ruby
reek --help
```

For a summary of those CLI options see [Command-Line Options](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Command-Line-Options).

### Via configuration files

In the most simple case, you can just drop a file called "settings.reek" in your root directory (name doesnt matter as long as it ends with "reek") and `reek` will just pick it up.

Here's a simple example:

```Yaml
---
Exclude:
  - "vendor"
  - "lib/not-your-code"
  - "lib/your-code/smelly.rb"
FeatureEnvy:
  exclude:
    - "AngularHelper"
    - "ApplicationController#http_auth_enabled?"
```

This would exlude the "vendor" directory and the "lib/not-your-code" directory as well as the single file "lib/your-code/smelly.rb" from scanning.
Furthermore `reek` would not report the [Feature Envy](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Feature-Envy) smell for "AngularHelper" and the "http_auth_enabled?" method in "ApplicationController".

Check out [Configuration Files](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Configuration-Files) and especially [Basic Smell Options](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Basic-Smell-Options) for further details.


### Smell suppression

 `reek` is not the police. In case you need to suppress a smell warning for whatever reasons have a look at [Smell Suppression](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Smell-Suppression)

### Exclude directories

List the directories and files you do not want to be scanned under the "Exclude" key like this:

```Yaml
---
Exclude:
  - "vendor"
  - "lib/not-your-code"
  - "lib/your-code/smelly.rb"
```

## Integration

Besides the obvious

```Bash
reek [options] [dir_or_source_file]*
```

there are quite a few other ways how to use reek in your projects:

* Use `reek`'s [Rake Task](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Rake-Task) to automate detecting code smells
* Add `reek`'s custom matcher to your [RSpec examples](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/RSpec-Integration)
* Include `reek` using the [Developer API](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki/Developer-Api)

## Developing reek / Contributing

The first thing you want to do after checking out the source code is to run bundler

```
bundle install
```

and then to run the tests:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/your/file_spec.rb            # Runs all tests in spec/your/file_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/your/file_spec.rb:23         # Runs test in line 23
bundle exec cucumber features/your_file.feature     # Runs all scenarios in your_file.feature
bundle exec cucumber features/your_file.feature:23  # Runs scenario at line 23
```

Or just run the whole test suite by running

```
bundle exec rake
```

From then on continue by following the establish [pull request workflow](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

If you don't feel like getting your hands dirty with code there a still other ways you can help us:

* Work on the [wiki](https://github.com/troessner/reek/wiki)
* Open up an [issue](https://github.com/troessner/reek/issues) and report bugs or suggest other improvements

## Output formats

`reek` supports 3 output formats:

* plain text (default)
* html (-H, --html)
* yaml (-y, --yaml)
